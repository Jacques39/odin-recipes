         <em><h1>EASY RIBEYE ROAST</h1></em>

         <p>I make this rib-eye roast on the bone every time rib eyes are on sale. Easy and delicious; there are never any leftovers! We usually cook ours medium-rare</p>

        <strong><h2>Easy Ribeye Roast Recipe</h2></strong>

           
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul> 
        
        <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in rib-eye roast</li>

    </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>      
        <li>Beat butter and garlic together in a bowl.</li>   
        <li>Poke several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over meat and season with salt and pepper. Place rib eye fat-side up in a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>     
        <li>Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue cooking until rib eye is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium.</li>
